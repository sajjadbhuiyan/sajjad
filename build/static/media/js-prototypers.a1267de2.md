### Prototypes based JavaScript

To many new developers, the JavaScript world may seem pretty strange, especially to those from a traditional object-oriented background. Just googling around for some JavaScript code and explanations might reveal pretty messy code and confusing terminology. 

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, therefore understanding the Prototype object is one of the most important concepts which JavaScript programmers need to know.

Any property or method inside a prototype object can be accessed by all new objects created from that function. Simple! But this is a theoretical definition.
